# A Brief History of Uromodulin

* Described in 1873 as produced by the tubular cells of the kidney and forming hyaline casts in the tubular lumen.   

* In 1950, Igor Tamm and Frank Horsfall precipitated it in NaCl solutions from the urine of healthy individuals.

* In 1985, my father rediscovered it as an immunomodulatory glycoprotein isolated from the urine of pregnant women using lectin affinity chromatography.

* Two years later, another group showed that uromodulin's protein sequence is identical to Tamm-Horsfall protein.

# The Basics

* Uromodulin is produced exclusively by renal epithelial cells (thick ascending limb), is the most abundant protein in the urine, and it is highly glycosylated (30% of it's weight).

* In the tubular lumen, uromodulin forms high-molecular weight filaments that constitute the matrix of hyaline casts.
  
* Levels of uromodulin in the urine and in the blood, where it is present in lower amounts, are valuable biomarkers for tubular mass and renal function.

* Common variants in the *UMOD* promoter are associated with risk of CKD and hypertension. Uncommon variants cause MCKD.

# The Genetics

* Conserved throughout evolution.

# The Genetics Continued

* Common variants in the *UMOD* promoter are associated with risk of CKD and hypertension.

* The unusually high prevalence of *UMOD* risk alleles suggests pathogen-driven selective pressure.

# Uromodulin and Immunity

* Comparing the cloned product to the native molecule demonstrated that all of the immunomodulatory activity resided in the carbohydrate moieties and the protein itself was not active.  

* In vitro studies demonstrated that it blocked the ability of T cells to respond to recall antigens like tetanus toxoid or candida.  

* Also shown to be a high affinity ligand for Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).  

* Differential glycosylation during pregnancy enhanced its immunoregulatory properties.

# Inflammatory Hypothesis

* Based on the affinity for TNF and its ability to down regulate T cells, it may play a protective role against inflammation in the tubules. 

* Incompletely glycosylated Uromodulin may lead to cellular ‘obstipation’ and a cascade of inflammatory and fibrotic signals including those that induce TNF and other inflammatory cytokine expression.

# Associations

* A plethora of rare inherited mutations in the Uromodulin gene have been shown to result in MCKD.

* Also associated with an increase in kidney stone formation.

* Plays a protective effect for bladder infections.

* Associated with hypertension, hyperuricemia and gout.

# The Clinical Characteristics of MCKD Caused by Uromodulin

* Presents in the 20 and 30s and often leads to renal failure in middle age.

* Slowly progressive kidney disease with impaired renal function typically appearing in the teenage years and ESRD between 20-70 years.

* A bland urine sediment with no or minimal proteinuria.

* Hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria with a fractional secretion of uric acid below 4% (normal = 8%).

* Obviously, expect a family history of kidney disease. Most common defect is a missense mutation.

* Contrast enhanced thin section CT will demonstrate multiple cysts in the medulla and corticomedullary regions ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm.   

* Medullary cysts on renal ultrasound are not present in most cases.

# MCKD Mechanism(s)

* Mutations lead to:
  + Retention of mutant uromodulin in the endoplasmic reticulum of tubular cells
  + Tubulointerstitial damage
  + Decreased levels of urinary uromodulin

# MCKD Clinical Takeaways

* Strong family history of gout or CKD with:
  + Early-onset gout
  + Unexplained CKD
  + Bland urine
  + Potentially normal ulatrasound

# Treatment
#### *Early treatment with allopurinol in familial juvenile hyerpuricaemic nephropathy (FJHN) ameliorates the long-term progression of renal disease.*

* 27 patients with MCKD were treated with allopurinol before the onset of gout.

* Efficacy of therapy appeared to depend upon when the drug was initiated. 

* Progression to ESRD within 2 to 10 years occurred in five of six patients in whom allopurinol was initiated when the serum creatinine was greater than 2.3

* No patient who started allopurinol therapy when the serum creatinine was less than 2.3 mg/dL progressed to ESRD during 10 to 34 years of follow-up.

* In eight of these patients without CKD at the time they initiated allopurinol, kidney function remained unchanged for up to 20 years.
