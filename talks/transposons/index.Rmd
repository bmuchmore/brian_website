# A Brief History of Transposons

* In the late 1940s, Barbara McClintock discovered that some genes could be mobile.

* Her studies of chromosome breakage in maize led her to discover a chromosome-breaking locus that could change its position within a chromosome. 

* Depending on where they inserted into a chromosome these mobile elements could reversibly alter the expression of other genes. 

* Although their existence was accepted relatively soon after by maize geneticists, the widespread nature of mobile genetic elements and the implications of McClintock’s discovery took decades to be widely recognized.

Recent research by neuroscientist Fred Gage and colleagues at the University of California (UC), San Diego, has shown that one of the most common types of jumping gene in people, called L1, is particularly abundant in human stem cells in the brain that ultimately differentiate into neurons and plays an important role in regulating neuronal development and proliferation. Although Gage and colleagues have found that increased L1 is associated with mental disorders such as Rett syndrome, a form of autism, and a neurological motor disease called Louis-Bar syndrome, "no one had looked very carefully" to see if the gene might also contribute to schizophrenia, he says.
