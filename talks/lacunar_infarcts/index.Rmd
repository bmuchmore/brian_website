# What is a lacunar stroke?

* Small (0.2 to 15 mm in diameter) non-cortical infarcts    

* Infarcts result in a small cavity, or lacune

* Caused by occlusion of a single penetrating branch of a large cerebral artery 

* Arise at acute angles from the
  + Large arteries of the circle of Willis
  + Stem of the MCA
  + Stem of the basilar 
  
* Thus, most lacunes occur in the
  + Basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, caudate)
  + Subcortical white matter (internal capsule and corona radiata)
  + Pons

# What is the etiology?

* Lipohyalinosis  

* Microatheroma

* Tiny emboli (never proven pathologically)

* Endothelial dysfunction

# What is the epidemiology?

* Incidence is around 25-50 per 100,000 in the population

* Approximately 25% of all ischemic strokes

* Higher incidence among African-American and Hispanics

# Clinically ABSENT signs 

* Lack of cortical signs
  + Aphasia
  + Agnosia
  + Neglect
  + Apraxia
  + Hemianopsia
  
<br>
  
* Also typically absent

# Clinically PRESENT signs 

* Unlike large artery brain ischemia, symptoms usually develop over hours/days
  + A stuttering course similar to large artery thrombosis can also ensue
  
* More than 20 lacunar syndromes have been described 

* Five have been validated as being clinically predictive of radiologic lacunes
  + Pure motor hemiparesis
  + Pure sensory stroke
  + Ataxic hemiparesis
  + Sensorimotor stroke
  + Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome

# Pure motor hemiparesis 

* ~50% of all lacunar syndromes 

* Weakness of face, arm, and leg on one side of the body

* May have dysarthria/dysphagia

* If preceded by hemiplegic TIAs --> "capsular warning syndrome"
  
* Typical location:
  + Internal capsule
  + Corona radiata
  + Basal pons
  + Medial medulla
  
* Positive predictive value:
  + 52-85%

# Pure sensory stroke 

* Numbness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body 
  
* Typical location:
  + Thalamus

  + Corona radiata
  
* Positive predictive value:
  + 95-100%

# Ataxic hemiparesis 

* Ipsilateral weakness and limb ataxia that is out of proportion to the motor deficit

* Also may exhibit ipsilateral dysarthria, nystagmus and gait deviation
  
* Typical location:
  + Internal capsule-corona radiata
  + Basal pons
  + Thalamus
  
* Positive predictive value:
  + 59-95%

# Sensorimotor stroke

* Weakness/numbness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body

* Ipsilateral sensory impairment
  
* Typical location:
  + Thalamocapsular
  + Basal pons
  + Lateral medulla
  
* Positive predictive value:
  + 51-87%

# Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome

* No sensory deficits 

* Facial weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and slight weakness/clumsiness of one hand
  
* Typical location:
  + Internal capsule
  + Corona radiata
  + Basal pons
  
* Positive predictive value:
  + ~96%

# Diagnosis

* Clinical syndrome that is consistent with CT or MRI

* CT has low sensitivity for detecting lacunes (30 to 44 percent)

* MRI is better

* Both have difficulty differentiating between acute and chronic lesions

* DWI is great if multiple infarcts of different ages are present
  + DWI overestimates size by up to 40%

# Treatment

* Lacunar stroke specific treatment does not exist

* Prevention is the best treatment

* Follow current stroke guidelines
  + Thrombolysis
  + Thrombectomy
  + Also Aspirin, VTE prophylaxis, statins, BP management, living zen
