summary = "A continuously updated electronic health record (EHR) database modified for public use provides real-time influenza and COVID-19 monitoring across the United States. Data include test results, geography, dates and ages. Influenza data also include diagnosis, prescriptions and insurance coverage.  We believe publicly available real-time monitoring for important common pathologies should be the EHR standard as it fosters enhanced public health recommendations, disease surveillance and modeling accuracy."
